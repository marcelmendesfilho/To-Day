#  To-Day

I wanted a very simple Mac menubar app that showed a list of items that I could check off over the day. Nothing long term, just day-by-day.

Every app I found had a terrific list of features, most of which I didn't want, so I wrote my own in SwiftUI for macOS 13.0 or later.

Use the **Edit Todosâ€¦** menu item to add, delete, edit and move your todos. Select them in the menu to mark them as complete or incomplete.

There are only two settings: **Complete at End** sorts the list in the menu, moving the completed todos to the end and **Launch on Login** sets whether you want the app to start automatically when you log in.

This app is free, but if you'd like to support my work, please [https://ko-fi.com/H2H3BU7SI](Buy Me a Coffee).

If you'd like to contact me, I'm [@troz@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@troz) on Mastodon.

Things to fix:

- [ ] Editing - SwiftUI jumps the insertion cursor to the end of the field when editing an existing todo.
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for editing, deleting and moving.
