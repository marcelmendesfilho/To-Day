<h1>To-Day</h1>
<h2>Release Notes: Version 1.0</h2>

<p>
  I wanted a very simple Mac menubar app that showed a list of items that I
  could check off over the day. Nothing long term, just day-by-day.
</p>
<p>
  Every app I found had a terrific list of features, most of which I didn't
  want, so I wrote my own in SwiftUI for macOS 13.0 or later.
</p>
<p>
  Use the **Edit Todosâ€¦** menu item to add, delete, edit and move your todos.
  Select them in the menu to mark them as complete or incomplete.
</p>
<p>
  There are only two settings: **Complete at End** sorts the list in the menu,
  moving the completed todos to the end and **Launch on Login** sets whether you
  want the app to start automatically when you log in.
